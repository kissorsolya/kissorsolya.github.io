ABCD Investigator, Supervisor

Mentee: Sarah Sampaio Izabel - PhD candidate at Stanford University

Along with Andrea N. Goldstein-Piekarski, I mentored Sarah Sampaio Izabel in her research project on the effects of sleep disturbances (as measured by Fitbit Charge 2 devices) on emotional regulation and mood in adolescents. We collaborated on using the ABCD Study, a socioeconomically diverse and multimodal dataset of neuropsychological and clinical measures, and applied generalized mixed-effect models to uncover the associations between sleep measures and emotion regulation. The findings from this research are currently being prepared for publication.
