description: 'This paper is a collaborative effort between our lab and Dr. Baharan Mirzasoleiman from UCLA. We aimed to identify stress trajectories in adolescents during the first year of COVID-19 by clustering longitudinal stress data and examining pre-pandemic brain markers of susceptibility to stress. Our findings reveal that 5% of adolescents reported persistently high stress levels, which were linked to pre-pandemic brain structure, sleep difficulties, and more advanced puberty stages. These insights inform preventive and treatment approaches for managing persistent stress during major life events like pandemics. The study draws on data from the ABCD Study® of U.S. youth during May 2020 – March 2021.'
