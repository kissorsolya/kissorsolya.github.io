description: 'In this applied machine learning study, we leveraged wearable data from Fitbit Charge HR 2 devices to identify key predictors of obesity risk in early adolescence. Analyzing data from 2,971 participants in the ABCD Study, we used glass box machine learning models to uncover critical risk thresholds and interactions among sociodemographic factors, sleep patterns, and physical activity. 
This research highlights the importance of inadequate sleep, physical inactivity, and socioeconomic disparities in predicting obesity, and demonstrates the clinical potential of wearable technology for continuous monitoring and guiding targeted interventions to reduce obesity rates in adolescents.'
