description: 'This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep habits and recreational screen time, including social media use and video gaming, in early adolescents. Utilizing data from 5,027 participants in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, we applied mixed-effect models to examine changes before and during the first year of the pandemic. Our findings reveal significant shifts in sleep patterns and a steep increase in screen time during the pandemic. Notably, higher social media use and video gaming were associated with poorer sleep behaviors, such as shorter time in bed, later bedtimes, and longer sleep onset latency. This research is part of a broader series of analyses examining the effects of the pandemic on adolescent health, with additional papers exploring brain impacts currently in preparation.'
