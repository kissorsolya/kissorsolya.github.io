description: 'This study utilized polysomnography (PSG) data collected over four years from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), spanning early adolescence to young adulthood, to reveal nuanced changes in sleep architecture associated with the emergence of alcohol use in adolescents. The findings suggest that alcohol use may interfere with the natural sleep-wake maturation process, highlighting potential long-term impacts on adolescent sleep development.'
