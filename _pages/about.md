Welcome! I am a **developmental sleep scientist**. My training in **Psychology** and **Computer Science** forms the foundation of my research at the intersection of data science and *neuroscience*.

As a Research Scientist at SRI International's Center for Health Sciences, I specialize in analyzing large-scale multimodal datasets to investigate how *sleep patterns*, *brain function*, and *social connectivity* intersect to affect adolescent health. I am also passionate about **applied machine learning** and **algorithm development**. By integrating interpretable machine learning techniques with statistical analysis and signal processing methods, I aim to elucidate **the role of sleep**  in healthy development and disease. 

As part of this work, I am engaged as an investigator in the *Adolescent Behavior and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study*, a demographically diverse multi-site consortium study that aims to determine the developmental trajectories of brain, neuropsychological, and emotional development of adolescents.
