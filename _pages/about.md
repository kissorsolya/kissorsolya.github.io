My training in psychology and computer science forms the foundation of my research at the intersection of data science and neuroscience. As a Research Scientist at SRI Internationalâ€™s Center for Health Sciences, I specialize in analyzing multimodal large-scale biomedical datasets to investigate how sleep patterns, brain function, and social connectivity intersect to affect adolescent health. I am also passionate about machine learning and algorithm development. By integrating interpretable machine learning techniques with statistical analysis and signal processing methods, I aim to elucidate the role of sleep in health and disease. As part of this work, I am engaged as an investigator in the Adolescent Behavior and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, a demographically diverse multi-site consortium study that aims to determine the developmental trajectories of brain, neuropsychological, and emotional development of adolescents.
