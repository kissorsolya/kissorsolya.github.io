### Sleep and contemporary screen use

I have conducted secondary data analysis using the longitudinal data collected in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to investigate the relationship between screen use behaviors and sleep across adolescence, considering sex differences, age effects and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These studies have shown the harmful effects of unlimited sedentary behavior on adolescent sleep, and cardiometabolic health and the need for education and interventions to optimize screen use behaviors, especially around bedtime to improve sleep quality in adolescents. This line of research also forms the foundation for investigating the effects of increasing use of electronic devices on brain development and inform physical activity and screen time guidelines for adolescents.

### Sleep difficulties and mental health across adolescence

My primary interests are exploring adolescence health with major focus on sleep problems and its physiological correlates using longitudinal self-reported data, heart rate variability, electrophysiology, and polysomnographic measures. I have also considered sleep difficulties as a risk factor for mental health problems, identifying specific developmental trajectories during adolescence, and examining how sleep could be a modifiable behavior to mitigate the development of disorders like anxiety and depression.
