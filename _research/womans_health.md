Our recent results show multiple associations between sleep behavior and menstrual problems in adolescent females, underscoring the importance of routine screening by healthcare providers and school health education providers. 

A new line of research investigates how PCOS interplays with sleep and glucose regulation. By utilizing wearable technology for non-invasive and continuous monitoring, we aim to track synchronized biological rhythms associated with PCOS, including hormone fluctuations and sleep health measures. Our goal is to enhance precision medicine in womenâ€™s health by improving early detection and treatment. This research also extends to adolescent females, identifying early markers of PCOS that may appear before the condition fully manifests. Addressing early detection and treatment of PCOS, especially in relation to insulin resistance and sleep disturbances, is crucial for the health and well-being of women affected by this condition.
