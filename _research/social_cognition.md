### Social cognition and social learning

I conducted experiments to get a better insight into social susceptibility and social learning processes within the context of the Autism Spectrum Disorder. My publications are focusing on the functional similarities between dogs’ and human children social signalling and attention modulation in social contexts. My work illustrates conceptual and methodological advancements related to three areas of social cognition, namely social stimulation, social categorization, and audience effect.

### Experimental psychology
I have extensive experience in experimental psychology, particularly in investigating the neurochemical and social factors that influence human behavior. In a recent study, I examined how intranasal oxytocin and the presence of an observer (audience effect) interact to affect motor performance and time perception. The findings revealed that oxytocin and social observation independently and interactively modulate both motor planning and the perception of time, highlighting oxytocin's broader influence on cognitive processes beyond social interactions.
