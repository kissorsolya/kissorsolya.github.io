### Interpretable machine learning and network analysis to reveal multimodal associations in neuropsychological datasets

I am committed to overcome the pitfalls of “black box” algorithms and improve the applicability of the advanced machine learning algorithms on clinical data by enhancing the interpretability and model evaluation standards. The novel computational techniques offer a unique opportunity to gain insight into the developmental processes and mental health problems by integrating and a variety of biomarkers and a wide range of measurements.
